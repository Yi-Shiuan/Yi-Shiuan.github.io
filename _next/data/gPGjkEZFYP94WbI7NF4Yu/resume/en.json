Make the whole team have a clear consensus and understanding of the requirements. Reduce development cycle and test time.\n\n## Knowledge Sharing\n\n1.

Due to the difficulty of upgrading the npm package of the system at that time and the huge difference between the ReactJS version and the mainstream version,\nAfter team discussion, I plan to re-plan and develop a new official website. In the scope of the entire new official website, I am responsible for the following projects\n\n- Lead system development\n- Adjust the way of using GraphQL, so that the data required by the page can be retrieved at one time to reduce the rendering time of the page\n- The design of the project structure allows Component to be reused in the desktop version and the mobile version to the maximum extent.\n- Because the existing website must be rebuilt in each environment, I made some changes in the new website so that one build can be deployed in multiple environments.\n- Solve the problem that the original website needs to maintain the routing table. In the new official website, the routing design is simplified and the logic corresponding to the routing is removed to make the logic of the entire system clearer.\n- The cash flow center of the existing website is another platform that is split out only for the common cash flow logic, so I propose to package the logic of the gold flow center into an npm package, and introduce it into the brand maintained by npm\n- Adopted functional component and used React Hooks\n\n## Plan the AWS architecture and relocate the IDC to AWS\n\nThe company originally used a self-built IDC migrate to AWS under the consideration of various parties. In the original team's plan, a large number of EC2 instances were used to relocate the existing system.\nThe cost of using large of number EC2 instance is very high, so during the relocation process, we made a series of changes to the characteristics of the cloud and the application environment, which saved us nearly 50% of the cost\n\n- The OS operating system is changed, and the Application other than the .net framework is converted to use the Linux system and deployed by container\n- Fully automated expansion and deployment, complete the system environment setting and Application deployment in a very short time without manual, saving a lot of capacity expenditures for building images\n- The test environment and CI Agent will be automatically shutdown and destroyed after the end of each workday, and will be automatically started before going to work the next day, reducing 50% off cost on AWS testing environment\n- An environment with a release preview version can be used for pre-launch checks, and it let service to \"warm up\" and provide real-time online traffic\n- Blue-green deployment and canary deployment\n- Our cloud planning can deploy any version to any environment\n\n## Build a team CI/CD process\n\nThe team did not have a reliable and stable CI and CD process at the beginning, often due to errors in deployment scripts and execution errors that required a large number of manual interventions or confusion in deployment versions, resulting in poor system stability.\nTherefore, I use [dotnet cake](https://cakebuild.net/) in the team to write the entire CI script, and plan a unified git commit message so that the artifact has a reliable version number,\nArtifact Server is also established, so that the entire Artifact has a complete management and storage location\n\nIn the CD part, I used Ansible as the script for team deployment, which improved the problem of manual intervention when deployment failed in the past, and ensured the stability and reliability of deployment to the greatest extent.\nIt also shortened the entire deployment time from 15 minutes to 3 minutes.\n\n\n## Build AWS Infrastructure as Code\n\nThe original setting of AWS relies on a lot of manual and experience setting. When setting up the environment, often because a certain option is not set, the entire service does not perform as expected.\nSo we adopted Terraform, through fixed scripts and parameter files, so that the entire AWS environment can be built more efficiently and accurately. When the environment needs to be changed, it only needs to be modified and stored in gitlab\nChanges to the AWS environment can be completed by setting the settings and handing them over to the team for review.\n\nWhen there is a major update on the AP part, we will use the canary deployment method for system testing, and the canary deployment is very troublesome for AWS settings.\nAs long as you make a mistake, the entire system will have abnormal behavior. Since we have adopted IaC, another benefit is that the cumbersome settings of `canary deployment` can also be simplified and quickly modified.\nAnd you can make changes to Production only after passing through the relevant test environment\n\n## Log collection systems and analysis tools\n\nWhile migrating to the cloud, I used ELK as a log collection and analysis tool. Using an r5.large machine, the system response only needs less than 2ms delay time at the level of 1800 logs per second.\nAnd the production log is automatically saved for 4 weeks, the test environment log is automatically saved for two weeks, and the response level of the log query does not exceed 30 seconds\n\n## Other achievements\n\n- Assist QA in setting up the infra of automated testing, and link the Job deployed by Jenkins to automatically trigger QA's Selenium testing\n- Import new technologies Terraform, Ansible, dotnet core, redis, docker into the team\n"},{"company":"Xuenn Private Limited","title":"IT Consultant","during":{"start":"2015-10-1","end":"2018-09-1"},"content":"\n## Lead 5 people to complete the development of Beijing racing game\n\nDuring my time at Xuenn, I led the teams of QA, DBA, Frontend and Backend to develop the new digital betting game `Beijing Racing Car` within 4 months.\nThe development process of this team adopts an agile development method.

Therefore, I worked with the TA team to study,\nIn this process, I tried to rewrite the entire program code, rewrite and adjust the program code for the behavior of GC, use the struct method to reduce the number of GC recycling, optimize the calculation process, and finally achieve a single transaction betting volume of `120,000` The number of bets per second.\n\n## Other achievements\n\n- Refactor the old system and import unit tests, the test coverage rate reaches 60%\n- Participate in the DevOps project, participate in the System Configuration group and conduct research on Ansible and Azure DevOps\n- Team release flow planning\n"},{"company":"XIANG SHANG GAMES","title":"Intern","during":{"start":"2014-02-1","end":"2014-09-1"},"content":"\n## Implement and design backend systems and training\n\nThe main reason why I entered the upward game was that the upward game wanted to use the ASP.NET MVC framework to replace the existing ASP.NET.\nAt that time, the Microsoft Most Valuable Expert who was also selected for ASP.NET was good at the MVC framework.\nMy first project is to use MVC to plan the structure of background modules and background.\n\nBecause the upward game wants to import MVC, I have done many MVC training courses in the company, so that the whole department can get started with the ASP.NET MVC framework faster.\n"},{"company":"National Taichung University of Science and Technology - Information management","title":"bachelor","during":{"start":"2010-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","end":"2014-09-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"content":"\n## Microsoft Most Value Professional(MVP)\n\n\nIn the third year of university, I started my admiration for MVP because I participated in the community star activity hosted by Microsoft.
